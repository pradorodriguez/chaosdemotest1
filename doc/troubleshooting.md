## 502 Error on /v1/products/?type=laptops
When Requesting the Products the Request returns a 502 Error message and "Service is not available".

### Step 1: Make sure your AKS Cluster is Running
```shell
az aks get-credentials --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP --name AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --overwrite-existing
```
### Step 2: See if the Pod is Running and Check Logs
```shell
kubectl get pod
```
Some ```contoso-traders-products-XXXX``` needs to be shown as ```Running```.
```shell
kubectl logs POD_NAME
```
There should be no Errors there. Otherwise go to Pod Errors.
### Step 3: Check if you can access the AKS LoadBalancer
```shell
$lbHost = kubectl get ingress contoso-traders-products -o jsonpath="{.items[*].spec.rules[*].host}";
$lbAddress = kubectl get ingress contoso-traders-products -o jsonpath="{.items[*].status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}";
```
Add the $lbAddress to your NEtwork Security Group inbound Rules of your ASK NSG so you can access the LoadBalancer directly using the DNS Name from $lbHost + /v1/products/?type=laptops.
Try calling and see if you get a 200 Response.
```shell
curl -v "${lbHost}/v1/products/?type=laptops"
```
If it works that means your NSG Rules are likely the problem.
Don't forget to remove the AKS LB NSG Rule afterwards.
### Step 4: Check if cert-manager worked properly and the certificate was issued
```shell
kubectl get certificate tls-secret             

NAME         READY   SECRET       AGE                    
tls-secret   True    tls-secret   **m
```
Check for logs on the cert-manager
```shell
kubectl get po -n cert-manager
kubectl logs cert-manager-POD-NAME -n cert-manager
```
### Step 5: Error with the certificate tls-secret
Delete the certificate
```shell
kubectl delete certificate tls-secret
```
Make sure the NSG AKS has an ALLOW-ALL Rule for the Cert-Manager to be able to verify the certificate:
```shell
$NSGAKSNAME=$DEPLOYMENT_NAME+"nsg-aks"
az network nsg rule create --resource-group $RG_NAME --nsg-name $NSGAKSNAME --name "AllowAll" --priority 999 --access Allow --direction Inbound --protocol "*" --source-address-prefix "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-address-prefix "*" --destination-port-range "*"

```

Apply the Certificate K8S Manifest in ```\src\app\ContosoTraders.Api.Products\Manifests\Certificate.yaml```
Replace AKS_FQDN with the value from $lbHost from Step 3.
```shell
kubectl apply -f Certificate.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready certificate/tls-secret --timeout=180s
```
Wait for the Certificate to be Ready="True" and Remove the NSG Rule
```shell
az network nsg rule delete --resource-group $RG_NAME --nsg-name $NSGAKSNAME --name "AllowAll"
```

## │ "The user, group or application 'appid=;iss=' does not have secrets list permission on key vault 
A conflict might have occurred during the Pipeline that prevented the policy operation from completing. 
This can happen if parallel operations are being performed on the Key Vault. 
Add the KeyVault Access Policy to include the Workload Identity:
```shell
$MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME="$DEPLOYMENT_NAME-wi"
$USER_ASSIGNED_OBJ_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'principalId' -o tsv)
az keyvault set-policy --name $KEYVAULT_NAME --object-id $USER_ASSIGNED_OBJ_ID --secret-permissions get list --key-permissions get list --certificate-permissions get list
```
Delete the Pod and wait for the Deployment to automatically start a new one
```shell
kubectl delete pod contoso-traders-products-****** 
```
## │ Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.CosmosException : Local Authorization is disabled. Use an AAD token to authorize all requests.
This means we need to enable local auth for our cosmosDBs.

```shell
$cosmosdb = az cosmosdb show --name $COSMOSDB_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME | ConvertFrom-Json
az resource update --ids $cosmosdb.id --set properties.disableLocalAuth=false --latest-include-preview
```

## Pod Errors
### Keyvault Access
The Pod is using Entra Workload Identity to authenticate to KeyVault.
Make sure it has the role "Key Vault Secrets User" assigned:
```shell
$USER_ASSIGNED_OBJ_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'principalId' -o tsv)
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $USER_ASSIGNED_OBJ_ID --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --scope $KEYVAULT_ID --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal
```  
Also the KeyVault Access Policy needs to include the Workload Identity:
```shell
az keyvault set-policy --name $KEYVAULT_NAME --object-id $USER_ASSIGNED_OBJ_ID --secret-permissions get list --key-permissions get list --certificate-permissions get list
```

### Database Query or Access
Our AKS deployed .NET Application uses the passwordless connection string with a configuration value of Authentication="Active Directory Default".This is received from KeyVault in Form of a Secret. 
The DefaultAzureCredential applies the managed identity that is associated with the hosted app / pod. 
The Workload Identity receives role "Key Vault Secrets User" and we assign access policy to KeyVault for the Workload Identity to get & list secrets.
In order for the App to be authenticated to the Azure SQL DB we need to have a user within the SQL Database for the workload identity.

Download [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) and Check for the Workload Identity User to be in the Database. 
Make sure you are ADMIN of the SQL Server to connect and Query.
```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals
```
